Vision: Become a professional, tough, responsible, and socially caring employee at the company.
Mission: Always update personal character to be more professional, committed, responsible, and loyal to the company. Developing the company has become more advanced in accordance with my capacity in the field of work that I embrace.

The person who is used to socializing, meeting with working with new people. I am someone who can make the right decisions even when under pressure. I always work on every job in detail and finish on time. I am a creative person. I like to find alternative solutions to various problems that exist and be open about all the best possible solutions. My creativity is very helpful in anticipating various problems and solving them with various solutions.

I've spent a year as database developer and data management for a business-to-business company that specializes in Costumer Relation Management Database. During that time, I've logged thousands of hours doing everything related to the database management. I currently manage 1 team of 4 Telemarketing temporary staff who work for Indonesia Infrastructure Week 2018, and i ensure that the quality of every submission meets our high standards. I'm also very familiar with Data management and have no trouble adapting to various software such as mysql, python, R studio, etc.
what i like most about my current job is that it gives me the opportunity to learn and be creative.
And I believe this position will do the same.
